Font Awesome Usage: You're using Font Awesome effectively for icons, but make sure the CDN link is always up to date.

Class Naming: Classes like icon-ts and icon -dots could be more descriptive or consistent (e.g., icon-dots instead of icon -dots).

Social Media Links: Some anchor tags have placeholders (#) for href. Replace them with real links or add meaningful placeholders.

CSS Linking: Ensure the style.css file includes the necessary styles for this layout.

Alt Attribute: The alt attribute for the image is generic. Make it more descriptive ( Profile picture of Sarwar Hossain).
